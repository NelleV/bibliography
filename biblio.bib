abstract="Protein secretion systems are complex molecular machineries that translocate proteins through the outer membrane, and sometimes through multiple other barriers. They have evolved by co-option of components from other envelope-associated cellular machineries, making them sometimes difficult to identify and discriminate. Here, we describe how to identify protein secretion systems in bacterial genomes using MacSyFinder. This flexible computational tool uses the knowledge stemming from experimental studies to identify homologous systems in genome data. It can be used with a set of predefined models---``TXSScan''---to identify all major secretion systems of diderm bacteria (i.e., with inner and with LPS-containing outer membranes). For this, it identifies and clusters colocalized components of secretion systems using sequence similarity searches with hidden Markov model protein profiles. Finally, it checks whether the genetic content and organization of clusters satisfy the constraints of the model. TXSScan models can be customized to search for variants of known systems. The models can also be built from scratch to identify novel systems. In this chapter, we describe a complete pipeline of analysis, including the identification of a reference set of experimentally studied systems, the identification of components and the construction of their protein profiles, the definition of the models, their optimization, and, finally, their use as tools to search genomic data.",

abstract="Stomata regulate rates of carbon assimilation and water loss. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses often modify stomatal behavior and therefore play pivotal roles in plant productivity. The size of the AM effect on stomatal conductance to water vapor (gs) has varied widely, has not always been apparent, and is unpredictable. We conducted a meta-analysis of 460 studies to determine the size of the AM effect under ample watering and drought and to examine how experimental conditions have influenced the AM effect. Across all host and symbiont combinations under all soil moisture conditions, AM plants have shown 24Â {\%} higher gsthan nonmycorrhizal (NM) controls. The promotion of gshas been over twice as great during moderate drought than under amply watered conditions. The AM influence on gshas been even more pronounced under severe drought, with over four times the promotion observed with ample water. Members of the Claroideoglomeraceae, Glomeraceae, and other AM families stimulated gsby about the same average amount. Colonization by native AM fungi has produced the largest promotion. Among single-AM symbionts, Glomus deserticola, Claroideoglomus etunicatum, and Funneliformis mosseae have had the largest average effects on gsacross studies. Dicotyledonous hosts, especially legumes, have been slightly more responsive to AM symbiosis than monocotyledonous hosts, and C3 plants have shown over twice the AM-induced promotion of C4 plants. The extent of root colonization is important, with heavily colonized plants showing {\texttimes}10 the gspromotion of lightly colonized plants. AM promotion of gshas been larger in growth chambers and in the field than in greenhouse studies, almost {\texttimes}3 as large when plants were grown under high light than low light, and {\texttimes}2.5 as large in purely mineral soils than in soils having an organic component. When AM plants have been compared with NM controls given NM pot culture, they have shown only half the promotion of gsas NM plants not given anything at inoculation to control for associated soil organisms. The AM effect has been much greater when AM plants were larger or had more phosphorus than NM controls. These findings should assist in further investigations of predictions and mechanisms of the AM influence on host gs.",

Despite their powerful predictivity, this lack of interpretability may be highly restrictive for applications with critical decisions at stake. On the other hand, algorithms with a simple structureâtypically decision trees, rule algorithms, or sparse linear modelsâare well known for their instability. This undesirable feature makes the conclusions of the data analysis unreliable and turns out to be a strong operational limitation. This motivates the design of SIRUS, based on random forests, which combines a simple structure, a remarkable stable behavior when data is perturbed, and an accuracy comparable to its competitors. We demonstrate the efficiency of the method both empirically (through experiments) and theoretically (with the proof of its asymptotic stability). A R/C++ software implementation sirus is available from CRAN. }

    abstract = {Theoretical results suggest that in order to learn the kind of
    complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g., in
    vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep
    architectures. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of
    non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or
    in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae.
    Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task,
    but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have
    recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success,
    beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This monograph discusses
    the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep
    architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks
    unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann
    Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.},

In this paper we evaluate the recently-proposed rule learning algorithm IREP on a large and diverse collection of benchmark problems. We show that while IREP is extremely efficient, it frequently gives error rates higher than those of C4.5 and C4.5rules. We then propose a number of modifications resulting in an algorithm RIPPERk that is very competitive with C4.5rules with respect to error rates, but much more efficient on large samples. RIPPERk obtains error rates lower than or equivalent to C4.5rules on 22 of 37 benchmark problems, scales nearly linearly with the number of training examples, and can efficiently process noisy datasets containing hundreds of thousands of examples.}

When the objects are ambiguous words, for example, different senses of a word occur in different maps, so âriverâ and âloanâ can both be close to âbankâ without being at all close to each other. Aspect maps resemble clustering because they model pair-wise similarities as a mixture of different types of similarity, but they also resemble local multi-dimensional scaling because they model each type of similarity by a twodimensional map. We demonstrate our method on a toy example, a database of human wordassociation data, a large set of images of handwritten digits, and a set of feature vectors that represent words.}

abstract = "Protein secretion is important for many biotic and abiotic interactions. The evolution of protein secretion systems of bacteria, and related nanomachines, occurred by the co-option of machineries for motility, conjugation, injection, or adhesion. Some of these secretion systems emerged many times, whereas others are unique. In most cases, their evolution occurred by successive rounds of gene accretion, deletion, and horizontal transfer, resulting in machines that can be very different from the original ones. The frequency with which such co-option processes occurred seems to depend on the complexity of the systems, their differences to the ancestral machines, the availability of genetic material to tinker with, and possibly on the mechanisms of effector recognition. Understanding the evolution of secretion systems illuminates their functional diversification and could drive the discovery of novel systems."

    the analyses in the field have been performed on different 3D
    representation forms (such as graphs). Here, we reproduce most of the
    previous results on the 3D genomic organization of the eukaryote
    Saccharomyces cerevisiae using analysis of 3D reconstructions. We show
    that many of these results can be reproduced in sparse reconstructions,
    generated from a small fraction of the experimental data (5\% of the data),
    and study the properties of such models. Finally, we propose for the first
    time a novel approach for improving the accuracy of 3D reconstructions by
    introducing additional predicted physical interactions to the model, based
    on orthologous interactions in an evolutionary-related organism and based
    on predicted functional interactions between genes. We demonstrate that
    this approach indeed leads to the reconstruction of improved models.},

Examples that are discussed include phylogenetic determination of orthology, the use of character state reconstruction analysis of gene function, and evolutionary analysis of rates and patterns of gene evolution.}

  broad selection of topics. These range from standard classics, such as the
  characterization of line graphs by eigenvalues, to more unusual areas, such
  as geometric embeddings of graphs and the study of graph homomorphisms. The
  authors' goal has been to develop each topic in a self-contained fashion,
  presenting the main tools and ideas, with an emphasis on their use in
  understanding concrete examples. A substantial proportion of the book covers
  topics that have not appeared in book form before, and as such it provides
  an accessible introduction to the research literature and to important open
  question in modern algebraic graph theory." "This book is primarily aimed at
  graduate students and researchers in graph theory, combinatories, or
  discrete mathematics in general. However, all the necessary graph theory is
  developed from scratch, so the only prerequisite is a first course in linear

    abstract = { Mediation is a causal process that evolves over time. Thus, a
study of mediation requires data collected throughout the process. However,
most applications of mediation analysis use cross-sectional rather than
longitudinal data. Another implicit assumption commonly made in longitudinal
designs for mediation analysis is that the same mediation process universally
applies to all members of the population under investigation. This assumption
ignores the important issue of ergodicity before aggregating the data across
subjects. We first argue that there exists a discrepancy between the concept
of mediation and the research designs that are typically used to investigate
it. Second, based on the concept of ergodicity, we argue that a given
mediation process probably is not equally valid for all individuals in a
population. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to propose a two-faceted
solution. The first facet of the solution is that we advocate a single-subject
time-series design that aligns data collection with researchersâ conceptual
understanding of mediation. The second facet is to introduce a flexible
statistical methodâthe state space modelâas an ideal technique to analyze
single-subject time series data in mediation studies. We provide an overview
of the state space method and illustrative applications using both simulated
and real time series data. Finally, we discuss additional issues related to
research design and modeling. }

However, due to the high sequencing cost and technical constraints, the resolution of most Hi-C datasets is coarse, resulting in a loss of information and biological interpretability. Here we develop DeepHiC, a generative adversarial network, to predict high-resolution Hi-C contact maps from low-coverage sequencing data. We demonstrated that DeepHiC is capable of reproducing high-resolution Hi-C data from as few as 1% downsampled reads. Empowered by adversarial training, our method can restore fine-grained details similar to those in high-resolution Hi-C matrices, boosting accuracy in chromatin loops identification and TADs detection, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy of prediction. Finally, application of DeepHiC to Hi-C data on mouse embryonic development can facilitate chromatin loop detection. We develop a web-based tool (DeepHiC, http://sysomics.com/deephic) that allows researchers to enhance their own Hi-C data with just a few clicks.},

@article{huang:integrative,
abstract = {Given the availability of genomic data, there have been emerging
interests in integrating multi-platform data. Here, we propose to model
genetics (single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)), epigenetics (DN
A methylation), and gene expression data as a biological process to delineate
phenotypic traits under the framework of causal mediation modeling. We propose
a regression model for the joint effect of SNPs, methyla
tion, gene expression, and their nonlinear interactions on the outcome and
develop a variance component score test for any arbitrary set of regression
coefficients. The test statistic under the null follows a mixt
u
re of chi-square distributions, which can be approximated using a
characteristic function inversion method or a perturbation procedure. We
construct tests for candidate models determined by different combinations of
SNPs, DNA methylation, gene expression, and interactions and further propose
an omnibus test to accommodate different models. We then study three
path-specific effects: the direct effect of SNPs on the outcome, the effect
mediated through expression, and the effect through methylation. We
characterize correspondences between the three path-specific effects and
coefficients in the regression model, which are influenced by causal relations
among SNPs, DNA methylation, and gene expression. We illustrate the utility of
our method in two genomic studies and numerical simulation studies. Copyright

	abstract = {Summary 
          Genome wide contact frequencies obtained using Hi-C-like experiments have raised novel challenges in terms of visualization and rationalization of chromosome structuring phenomena. In bacteria, display of Hi-C data should be congruent with the circularity of chromosomes. However, standard representations under the form of square matrices or horizontal bands are not adapted to periodic conditions as those imposed by (most) bacterial chromosomes. Here, we fill this gap and propose a Python library, built upon the widely used Matplotlib library, to display Hi-C data in circular strips, together with the possibility to overlay genomic data. The proposed tools are light and fast, aiming to facilitate the exploration and understanding of bacterial chromosome structuring data. The library further includes the possibility to handle linear chromosomes, providing a fresh way to display and explore eukaryotic data.

abstract = {Visualization techniques are of increasing importance in exploring and analyzing large amounts of multidimensional information. One important class of visualization techniques which is particularly interesting for visualizing very large multidimensional data sets is the class of pixel-oriented techniques. The basic idea of pixel-oriented visualization techniques is to represent as many data objects as possible on the screen at the same time by mapping each data value to a pixel of the screen and arranging the pixels adequately. A number of different pixel-oriented visualization techniques have been proposed in recent years and it has been shown that the techniques are useful for visual data exploration in a number of different application contexts. In this paper, we discuss a number of issues which are of high importance in developing pixel-oriented visualization techniques. The major goal of this article is to provide a formal basis of pixel-oriented visualization techniques and show that the design decisions in developing them can be seen as solutions of well-defined optimization problems. This is true for the mapping of the data values to colors, the arrangement of pixels inside the subwindows, the shape of the subwindows, and the ordering of the dimension subwindows. The paper also discusses the design issues of special variants of pixel-oriented techniques for visualizing large spatial data sets. The optimization functions for the mentioned design decisions are important for the effectiveness of the resulting visualizations. We show this by evaluating the optimization functions and comparing the results to the visualizations obtained in a number of different application.},

              . Typhimurium that contribute to the attachment and invasion of the intestinal epithelium, prevent immune activation, and modulate the host glycome. Here we find that the deletion of
              chiA

              chiA
              gene and ChiA protein expression was solely induced when bacteria gain contact with polarized IEC. The induction of
              chiA

ChiA secretion was completely abolished when accessory genes within the chitinase operon encoding for a holin and a peptidoglycan hydrolase were deleted. Holins, peptidoglycan hydrolases, and large extracellular enzymes in close proximity have been described as components of the bacterial holin/peptidoglycan hydrolase-dependent protein secretion system or Type 10 Secretion System. Overall, our results confirm that chitinase A is an important virulence factor, tightly regulated by ChiR, that promotes adhesion and invasion upon contact with polarized IEC and is likely secreted by a Type 10 Secretion System (T10SS).},

abstract = {Summary This chapter presents a general overview of type III secretion system (T3SS) regulation in the main pathogenic bacteria, and focuses on the different aspects of the regulation of T3SS gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pathogenic bacteria occupy very different infection foci; for instance, the animal pathogens Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. live intracellularly after successful invasion, whereas Yersinia spp., P. aeruginosa, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) predominantly remain extracellular. Therefore, different stimuli could be used to up or downregulate the expression of T3SS genes: temperature, divalent cations, host cell contact, serum, or other factors. Although the mechanism by which metabolic pathways influence virulence gene expression in bacteria is unclear, the example of P. aeruginosa detailed could facilitate progress in that field. It has been shown that T3SS expression is dependent on cell density and that exsCEBA operon expression decreases rapidly in the second part of stationary phase, and also that indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), naphthalenacetic, and 3-hydroxykynurenine inhibit exsCEBA operon expression at millimolar concentrations. In 2005, Wu and coworkers proposed that the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa could adapt to the host by sensing alterations in the host immune function and respond by enhancing the virulence phenotype. Despite the large number of genes that influence the regulation of the expression of T3SS genes in P. aeruginosa, only a minority have been shown to have a precise role. Both fundamental and applied research can make the inhibition of T3SS expression as one of the first new antibacterial therapeutics.}

    edition = {1st},
    abstract = {Methods of dimensionality reduction provide a way to
    understand and visualize the structure of complex data sets. Traditional
    methods like principal component analysis and classical metric
    multidimensional scaling suffer from being based on linear models. Until
    recently, very few methods were able to reduce the data dimensionality in
    a nonlinear way. However, since the late nineties, many new methods have
    been developed and nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also called
    manifold learning, has become a hot topic. New advances that account for
    this rapid growth are, e.g. the use of graphs to represent the manifold
    topology, and the use of new metrics like the geodesic distance. In
    addition, new optimization schemes, based on kernel techniques and
    spectral decomposition, have lead to spectral embedding, which encompasses
    many of the recently developed methods. This book describes existing and
    advanced methods to reduce the dimensionality of numerical databases. For
    each method, the description starts from intuitive ideas, develops the
    necessary mathematical details, and ends by outlining the algorithmic
    implementation. Methods are compared with each other with the help of
    different illustrative examples. The purpose of the book is to summarize
    clear facts and ideas about well-known methods as well as recent
    developments in the topic of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. With this
    goal in mind, methods are all described from a unifying point of view, in
    order to highlight their respective strengths and shortcomings. The book
    is primarily intended for statisticians, computer scientists and data
    analysts. It is also accessible to other practitioners having a basic
    background in statistics and/or computational learning, like psychologists
    (in psychometry) and economists.}

              Bacteria of the genus 
              Streptomyces 
              are prolific producers of specialized metabolites, including antibiotics. The linear chromosome includes a central region harboring core genes, as well as extremities enriched in specialized metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters. Here, we show that chromosome structure in 
              Streptomyces ambofaciens 
              correlates with genetic compartmentalization during exponential phase. Conserved, large and highly transcribed genes form boundaries that segment the central part of the chromosome into domains, whereas the terminal ends tend to be transcriptionally quiescent compartments with different structural features. The onset of metabolic differentiation is accompanied by a rearrangement of chromosome architecture, from a rather âopenâ to a âclosedâ conformation, in which highly expressed specialized metabolite biosynthetic genes form new boundaries. Thus, our results indicate that the linear chromosome of 
              S. ambofaciens 
              is partitioned into structurally distinct entities, suggesting a link between chromosome folding, gene expression and genome evolution.},

abstract = {RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is the major small
RNA-mediated epigenetic pathway in plants. RdDM requires a specialized
transcriptional machinery that comprises two plant-specific RNA polymerases -
Pol IV and Pol V - and a growing number of accessory proteins, the functions
of which in the RdDM mechanism are only partially understood. Recent work has
revealed variations in the canonical RdDM pathway and identified factors that
recruit Pol IV and Pol V to specific target sequences. RdDM, which
transcriptionally represses a subset of transposons and genes, is implicated
in pathogen defence, stress responses and reproduction, as well as in
interallelic and intercellular communication.},

The method can best be thought of as an analysis approach, to guide and assist in the use of any of a wide range of available clustering algorithms. We call the new methodology consensus clustering, and in conjunction with resampling techniques, it provides for a method to represent the consensus across multiple runs of a clustering algorithm and to assess the stability of the discovered clusters. The method can also be used to represent the consensus over multiple runs of a clustering algorithm with random restart (such as K-means, model-based Bayesian clustering, SOM, etc.), so as to account for its sensitivity to the initial conditions. Finally, it provides for a visualization tool to inspect cluster number, membership, and boundaries. We present the results of our experiments on both simulated data and real gene expression data aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the methodology in discovering biologically meaningful clusters.",

are interested in testing gene expression profiles for different

based on the ANOVA model to identify genes that
have different gene expression profiles among experimental
groups in time-course experiments. Especially,
we propose a permutation test which does
not require the normality assumption. For this test,
we use residuals from the ANOVA model only with
time-effects. Using this test, we detect genes that
have different gene expression profiles among experimental
groups. The proposed model is illustrated
using cDNA microarrays of 3840 genes obtained in
an experiment to search for changes in gene expression
profiles during neuronal differentiation of cortical
stem cells.Availability: A set of programs written by R will be

is folded in three-dimensional (3D) space is crucial for unravelling the
complex regulatory mechanisms underlying the differentiation and proliferation
of cells. With recent high-throughput adaptations of chromosome conformation
capture in techniques such as single-cell Hi-C, it is now possible to probe 3D
information of chromosomes genome-wide. Such experiments, however, only
provide sparse information about contacts between regions in the genome. We
have developed a tool, based on manifold based optimization (MBO), that
reconstructs 3D structures from such contact information. We show that MBO
allows for reconstruction of 3D genomes more consistent with the original
contact map, and with fewer structural violations compared to other, related
methods. Since MBO is also computationally fast, it can be used for
high-throughput and large-scale 3D reconstruction of entire genomes.</p>},

The discovery and application of CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems has spurred recent interest in the identification and classification of new types of defence systems. Many new defence systems have recently been reported but there is a lack of accessible tools available to identify homologs of these systems in different genomes. Here, we report the Prokaryotic Antiviral Defence LOCator (PADLOC), a flexible and scalable open-source tool for defence system identification. With PADLOC, defence system genes are identified using HMM-based homologue searches, followed by validation of system completeness using gene presence/absence and synteny criteria specified by customisable system classifications. We show that PADLOC identifies defence systems with high accuracy and sensitivity. Our modular approach to organising the HMMs and system classifications allows additional defence systems to be easily integrated into the PADLOC database. To demonstrate application of PADLOC to biological questions, we used PADLOC to identify six new subtypes of known defence systems and a putative novel defence system comprised of a helicase, methylase and ATPase. PADLOC is available as a standalone package (https://github.com/padlocbio/padloc) and as a webserver (https://padloc.otago.ac.nz).}",

low-dimensional representations of the data that account for zero inflation
(dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count nature of the data. We demonstrate,
with simulations and real data, that the model and its associated estimation
procedure are able to give a more stable and accurate low-dimensional
representation of the data than principal component analysis (PCA) and
zero-inflated factor analysis (ZIFA), without the need for a preliminary

Here, we describe the principles and implementation of the statistical coupling analysis (SCA), a method to reveal this pattern through analysis of coevolution between amino acids in an ensemble of homologous sequences. The basic result is a decomposition of protein structures into groups of contiguous amino acids called âsectorsâ which have been linked to conserved functional properties. This work provides conceptual and practical tools for sector analysis in any sufficiently well-represented protein family, and represents a necessary basis for broadly testing the concept of protein sectors.},

	abstract = {Most microbes on our planet remain uncultured and poorly studied. Recent efforts to catalog their genetic diversity have revealed that a significant fraction of the observed microbial genes are functional and evolutionary untraceable, lacking homologs in reference databases. Despite their potential biological value, these apparently unrelated orphan genes from uncultivated taxa have been routinely discarded in metagenomics surveys. Here, we analyzed a global multi-habitat dataset covering 151,697 medium and high-quality metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), 5,969 single-amplified genomes (SAGs), and 19,642 reference genomes, and identified 413,335 highly curated novel protein families under strong purifying selection out of previously considered orphan genes. These new protein families, representing a three-fold increase over the total number of prokaryotic orthologous groups described to date, spread out across the prokaryote phylogeny, can span multiple habitats, and are notably overrepresented in recently discovered taxa. By genomic context analysis, we pinpointed thousands of unknown protein families to phylogenetically conserved operons linked to energy production, xenobiotic metabolism and microbial resistance. Most remarkably, we found 980 previously neglected protein families that can accurately distinguish entire uncultivated phyla, classes, and orders, likely representing synapomorphic traits that fostered their divergence. The systematic curation and evolutionary analysis of the unique genetic repertoire of uncultivated taxa opens new avenues for understanding the biology and ecological roles of poorly explored lineages at a global scale.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization. The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighbor-hood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

	abstract = {Renewable fuels are needed to replace fossil fuels in the immediate future. Lignocellulosic bioenergy crops provide a renewable alternative that sequesters atmospheric carbon. To prevent displacement of food crops, it would be advantageous to grow biofuel crops on marginal lands. These lands will likely face more frequent and extreme drought conditions than conventional agricultural land, so it is crucial to see how proposed bioenergy crops fare under these conditions and how that may affect lignocellulosic biomass composition and saccharification properties. We found that while drought impacts the plant cell wall of 
              Sorghum bicolor 
              differently according to tissue and timing of drought induction, drought-induced cell wall compositional modifications are relatively minor and produce no negative effect on biomass conversion. This contrasts with the cell wall-related transcriptome, which had a varied range of highly variable genes (HVGs) within four cell wall-related GO categories, depending on the tissues surveyed and time of drought induction. Further, many HVGs had expression changes in which putative impacts were not seen in the physical cell wall or which were in opposition to their putative impacts. Interestingly, most pre-flowering drought-induced cell wall changes occurred in the leaf, with matrix and lignin compositional changes that did not persist after recovery from drought. Most measurable physical post-flowering cell wall changes occurred in the root, affecting mainly polysaccharide composition and cross-linking. This study couples transcriptomics to cell wall chemical analyses of a C4 grass experiencing progressive and differing drought stresses in the field. As such, we can analyze the cell wall-specific response to agriculturally relevant drought stresses on the transcriptomic level and see whether those changes translate to compositional or biomass conversion differences. Our results bolster the conclusion that drought stress does not substantially affect the cell wall composition of specific aerial and subterranean biomass nor impede enzymatic hydrolysis of leaf biomass, a positive result for biorefinery processes. Coupled with previously reported results on the root microbiome and rhizosphere and whole transcriptome analyses of this study, we can formulate and test hypotheses on individual gene candidatesâ function in mediating drought stress in the grass cell wall, as demonstrated in sorghum.},

	abstract = {Facing the abundance and diversity of phages, bacteria have developed multiple anti-phage mechanisms. In the past three years, the number of known anti-phage mechanisms has been expanded by at least 5-fold rendering our view of prokaryotic immunity obsolete. Most anti-phage systems have been studied as standalone mechanisms, however many examples demonstrate strains encode not one but several anti-viral mechanisms. How these different systems integrate into an anti-viral arsenal at the strain level remains to be elucidated. Much could be learned from establishing fundamental description of features such as the number and diversity of anti-phage systems encoded in a given genome. To address this question, we developed DefenseFinder, a tool that automatically detects known anti-phage systems in prokaryotic genomes. We applied DefenseFinder to \&gt;20 000 fully sequenced genomes, generating a systematic and quantitative view of the anti-viral arsenal of prokaryotes. We show prokaryotic genomes encode on average five anti-phage systems from three different families of systems. This number varies drastically from one strain to another and is influenced by the genome size and the number of prophages encoded. Distributions of different systems are also very heterogenous with some systems being enriched in prophages and in specific clades. Finally, we provide a detailed comparison of the anti-viral arsenal of 15 common bacterial species, revealing drastic differences in anti-viral strategies. Overall, our work provides a free and open-source software, available as a command line tool or, on a webserver. It allows the rapid detection of anti-phage systems, enables a comprehensive description of the anti-viral arsenal of prokaryotes and paves the way for large scale genomics study in the field of anti-phage defense.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

 abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The
`lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the
absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the
nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are
exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest
that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset
selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset
selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an
interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by
Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a
variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and
tree-based models are briefly described.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2021.02.04.429864},
	abstract = {We address the challenge of inferring a consensus 3D model of genome architecture from Hi-C data. Existing approaches most often rely on a two step algorithm: first convert the contact counts into distances, then optimize an objective function akin to multidimensional scaling (MDS) to infer a 3D model. Other approaches use a maximum likelihood approach, modeling the contact counts between two loci as a Poisson random variable whose intensity is a decreasing function of the distance between them. However, a Poisson model of contact counts implies that the variance of the data is equal to the mean, a relationship that is often too restrictive to properly model count data. 
          We first confirm the presence of overdispersion in several real Hi-C data sets, and we show that the overdispersion arises even in simulated data sets. We then propose a new model, called Pastis-NB, where we replace the Poisson model of contact counts by a negative binomial one, which is parametrized by a mean and a separate dispersion parameter. The dispersion parameter allows the variance to be adjusted independently from the mean, thus better modeling overdispersed data. We compare the results of Pastis-NB to those of several previously published algorithms: three MDS-based methods (ShRec3D, ChromSDE, and Pastis-MDS) and a statistical methods based on a Poisson model of the data (Pastis-PM). We show that the negative binomial inference yields more accurate structures on simulated data, and more robust structures than other models across real Hi-C replicates and across different resolutions.

	abstract = {Understanding the molecular response of plants to drought is critical to efforts to improve agricultural yields under increasingly frequent droughts. We grew 2 cultivars of the naturally drought-tolerant food crop sorghum in the field under drought stress. We sequenced the mRNA from weekly samples of these plants, resulting in a molecular profile of drought response over the growing season. We find molecular differences in the 2 cultivars that help explain their differing tolerances to drought and evidence of a disruption in the plant{\textquoteright}s symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Our findings are of practical importance for agricultural breeding programs, while the resulting data are a resource for the plant and microbial communities for studying the dynamics of drought response.Drought is the most important environmental stress limiting crop yields. The C4 cereal sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is a critical food, forage, and emerging bioenergy crop that is notably drought-tolerant. We conducted a large-scale field experiment, imposing preflowering and postflowering drought stress on 2 genotypes of sorghum across a tightly resolved time series, from plant emergence to postanthesis, resulting in a dataset of nearly 400 transcriptomes. We observed a fast and global transcriptomic response in leaf and root tissues with clear temporal patterns, including modulation of well-known drought pathways. We also identified genotypic differences in core photosynthesis and reactive oxygen species scavenging pathways, highlighting possible mechanisms of drought tolerance and of the delayed senescence, characteristic of the stay-green phenotype. Finally, we discovered a large-scale depletion in the expression of genes critical to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, with a corresponding drop in AM fungal mass in the plants{\textquoteright} roots.},

    abstract = "{For eukaryotic cells, the biological processes involving regulatory DNA elements play an important role in cell cycle. Understanding 3D spatial arrangements of chromosomes and revealing long-range chromatin interactions are critical to decipher these biological processes. In recent years, chromosome conformation capture (3C) related techniques have been developed to measure the interaction frequencies between long-range genome loci, which have provided a great opportunity to decode the 3D organization of the genome. In this paper, we develop a new Bayesian framework to derive the 3D architecture of a chromosome from 3C-based data. By modeling each chromosome as a polymer chain, we define the conformational energy based on our current knowledge on polymer physics and use it as prior information in the Bayesian framework. We also propose an expectation-maximization (EM) based algorithm to estimate the unknown parameters of the Bayesian model and infer an ensemble of chromatin structures based on interaction frequency data. We have validated our Bayesian inference approach through cross-validation and verified the computed chromatin conformations using the geometric constraints derived from fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments. We have further confirmed the inferred chromatin structures using the known genetic interactions derived from other studies in the literature. Our test results have indicated that our Bayesian framework can compute an accurate ensemble of 3D chromatin conformations that best interpret the distance constraints derived from 3C-based data and also agree with other sources of geometric constraints derived from experimental evidence in the previous studies. The source code of our approach can be found in https://github.com/wangsy11/InfMod3DGen.}",

Noting that the kernel matrix implicitly maps the data into a nonlinear feature space, we show how to discover a mapping that "unfolds" the underlying manifold from which the data was sampled. The kernel matrix is constructed by maximizing the variance in feature space subject to local constraints that preserve the angles and distances between nearest neighbors. The main optimization involves an instance of semidefinite programming---a fundamentally different computation than previous algorithms for manifold learning, such as Isomap and locally linear embedding. The optimized kernels perform better than polynomial and Gaussian kernels for problems in manifold learning, but worse for problems in large margin classification. We explain these results in terms of the geometric properties of different kernels and comment on various interpretations of other manifold learning algorithms as kernel methods.},

            Recent studies have demonstrated that drought leads to dramatic, highly conserved shifts in the root microbiome. At present, the molecular mechanisms underlying these responses remain largely uncharacterized. Here we employ genome-resolved metagenomics and comparative genomics to demonstrate that carbohydrate and secondary metabolite transport functionalities are overrepresented within drought-enriched taxa. These data also reveal that bacterial iron transport and metabolism functionality is highly correlated with drought enrichment. Using time-series root RNA-Seq data, we demonstrate that iron homeostasis within the root is impacted by drought stress, and that loss of a plant phytosiderophore iron transporter impacts microbial community composition, leading to significant increases in the drought-enriched lineage, Actinobacteria. Finally, we show that exogenous application of iron disrupts the drought-induced enrichment of Actinobacteria, as well as their improvement in host phenotype during drought stress. Collectively, our findings implicate iron metabolism in the root microbiomeâs response to drought and may inform efforts to improve plant drought tolerance to increase food security.},

We derive an approximation for the multiple family FDR for independently distributed test statistics: q, the level at which the BH procedure is applied, times the number of families tested plus the number of discoveries, divided by the number of discoveries plus I. We provide a universal bound for the FDR of the discoveries in the new hierarchical testing approach, 2 x 1.44 x q, and demonstrate in simulations that when the data has an hierarchical structure the new testing approach can be considerably more powerful than the BH procedure.},
