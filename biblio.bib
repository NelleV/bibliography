abstract="Stomata regulate rates of carbon assimilation and water loss. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses often modify stomatal behavior and therefore play pivotal roles in plant productivity. The size of the AM effect on stomatal conductance to water vapor (gs) has varied widely, has not always been apparent, and is unpredictable. We conducted a meta-analysis of 460 studies to determine the size of the AM effect under ample watering and drought and to examine how experimental conditions have influenced the AM effect. Across all host and symbiont combinations under all soil moisture conditions, AM plants have shown 24 {\%} higher gsthan nonmycorrhizal (NM) controls. The promotion of gshas been over twice as great during moderate drought than under amply watered conditions. The AM influence on gshas been even more pronounced under severe drought, with over four times the promotion observed with ample water. Members of the Claroideoglomeraceae, Glomeraceae, and other AM families stimulated gsby about the same average amount. Colonization by native AM fungi has produced the largest promotion. Among single-AM symbionts, Glomus deserticola, Claroideoglomus etunicatum, and Funneliformis mosseae have had the largest average effects on gsacross studies. Dicotyledonous hosts, especially legumes, have been slightly more responsive to AM symbiosis than monocotyledonous hosts, and C3 plants have shown over twice the AM-induced promotion of C4 plants. The extent of root colonization is important, with heavily colonized plants showing {\texttimes}10 the gspromotion of lightly colonized plants. AM promotion of gshas been larger in growth chambers and in the field than in greenhouse studies, almost {\texttimes}3 as large when plants were grown under high light than low light, and {\texttimes}2.5 as large in purely mineral soils than in soils having an organic component. When AM plants have been compared with NM controls given NM pot culture, they have shown only half the promotion of gsas NM plants not given anything at inoculation to control for associated soil organisms. The AM effect has been much greater when AM plants were larger or had more phosphorus than NM controls. These findings should assist in further investigations of predictions and mechanisms of the AM influence on host gs.",

    complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g., in

    non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or
    in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae.
    Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task,
    but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have
    recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success,
    beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This monograph discusses
    the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep
    architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks
    unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann
    Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.},

When the objects are ambiguous words, for example, different senses of a word occur in different maps, so “river” and “loan” can both be close to “bank” without being at all close to each other. Aspect maps resemble clustering because they model pair-wise similarities as a mixture of different types of similarity, but they also resemble local multi-dimensional scaling because they model each type of similarity by a twodimensional map. We demonstrate our method on a toy example, a database of human wordassociation data, a large set of images of handwritten digits, and a set of feature vectors that represent words.}

abstract = "Protein secretion is important for many biotic and abiotic interactions. The evolution of protein secretion systems of bacteria, and related nanomachines, occurred by the co-option of machineries for motility, conjugation, injection, or adhesion. Some of these secretion systems emerged many times, whereas others are unique. In most cases, their evolution occurred by successive rounds of gene accretion, deletion, and horizontal transfer, resulting in machines that can be very different from the original ones. The frequency with which such co-option processes occurred seems to depend on the complexity of the systems, their differences to the ancestral machines, the availability of genetic material to tinker with, and possibly on the mechanisms of effector recognition. Understanding the evolution of secretion systems illuminates their functional diversification and could drive the discovery of novel systems."

    the analyses in the field have been performed on different 3D
    representation forms (such as graphs). Here, we reproduce most of the
    previous results on the 3D genomic organization of the eukaryote
    Saccharomyces cerevisiae using analysis of 3D reconstructions. We show
    that many of these results can be reproduced in sparse reconstructions,
    generated from a small fraction of the experimental data (5\% of the data),
    and study the properties of such models. Finally, we propose for the first
    time a novel approach for improving the accuracy of 3D reconstructions by
    introducing additional predicted physical interactions to the model, based
    on orthologous interactions in an evolutionary-related organism and based
    on predicted functional interactions between genes. We demonstrate that
    this approach indeed leads to the reconstruction of improved models.},

  graduate students and researchers in graph theory, combinatories, or
  discrete mathematics in general. However, all the necessary graph theory is
  developed from scratch, so the only prerequisite is a first course in linear

    abstract = { Mediation is a causal process that evolves over time. Thus, a
study of mediation requires data collected throughout the process. However,
most applications of mediation analysis use cross-sectional rather than
longitudinal data. Another implicit assumption commonly made in longitudinal
designs for mediation analysis is that the same mediation process universally
applies to all members of the population under investigation. This assumption
ignores the important issue of ergodicity before aggregating the data across
subjects. We first argue that there exists a discrepancy between the concept
of mediation and the research designs that are typically used to investigate
it. Second, based on the concept of ergodicity, we argue that a given
mediation process probably is not equally valid for all individuals in a
population. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to propose a two-faceted
solution. The first facet of the solution is that we advocate a single-subject
time-series design that aligns data collection with researchers’ conceptual
understanding of mediation. The second facet is to introduce a flexible
statistical method—the state space model—as an ideal technique to analyze
single-subject time series data in mediation studies. We provide an overview
of the state space method and illustrative applications using both simulated
and real time series data. Finally, we discuss additional issues related to
research design and modeling. }

@article{huang:integrative,
abstract = {Given the availability of genomic data, there have been emerging
interests in integrating multi-platform data. Here, we propose to model
genetics (single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)), epigenetics (DN
A methylation), and gene expression data as a biological process to delineate
phenotypic traits under the framework of causal mediation modeling. We propose
a regression model for the joint effect of SNPs, methyla
tion, gene expression, and their nonlinear interactions on the outcome and
develop a variance component score test for any arbitrary set of regression
coefficients. The test statistic under the null follows a mixt
u
re of chi-square distributions, which can be approximated using a
characteristic function inversion method or a perturbation procedure. We
construct tests for candidate models determined by different combinations of
SNPs, DNA methylation, gene expression, and interactions and further propose
an omnibus test to accommodate different models. We then study three
path-specific effects: the direct effect of SNPs on the outcome, the effect
mediated through expression, and the effect through methylation. We
characterize correspondences between the three path-specific effects and
coefficients in the regression model, which are influenced by causal relations
among SNPs, DNA methylation, and gene expression. We illustrate the utility of
our method in two genomic studies and numerical simulation studies. Copyright

abstract = {Visualization techniques are of increasing importance in exploring and analyzing large amounts of multidimensional information. One important class of visualization techniques which is particularly interesting for visualizing very large multidimensional data sets is the class of pixel-oriented techniques. The basic idea of pixel-oriented visualization techniques is to represent as many data objects as possible on the screen at the same time by mapping each data value to a pixel of the screen and arranging the pixels adequately. A number of different pixel-oriented visualization techniques have been proposed in recent years and it has been shown that the techniques are useful for visual data exploration in a number of different application contexts. In this paper, we discuss a number of issues which are of high importance in developing pixel-oriented visualization techniques. The major goal of this article is to provide a formal basis of pixel-oriented visualization techniques and show that the design decisions in developing them can be seen as solutions of well-defined optimization problems. This is true for the mapping of the data values to colors, the arrangement of pixels inside the subwindows, the shape of the subwindows, and the ordering of the dimension subwindows. The paper also discusses the design issues of special variants of pixel-oriented techniques for visualizing large spatial data sets. The optimization functions for the mentioned design decisions are important for the effectiveness of the resulting visualizations. We show this by evaluating the optimization functions and comparing the results to the visualizations obtained in a number of different application.},

    year = {2007},
    isbn = {0387393501},
    publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
    edition = {1st},
    abstract = {Methods of dimensionality reduction provide a way to
    understand and visualize the structure of complex data sets. Traditional
    methods like principal component analysis and classical metric
    multidimensional scaling suffer from being based on linear models. Until
    recently, very few methods were able to reduce the data dimensionality in
    a nonlinear way. However, since the late nineties, many new methods have
    been developed and nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also called
    manifold learning, has become a hot topic. New advances that account for
    this rapid growth are, e.g. the use of graphs to represent the manifold
    topology, and the use of new metrics like the geodesic distance. In
    addition, new optimization schemes, based on kernel techniques and
    spectral decomposition, have lead to spectral embedding, which encompasses
    many of the recently developed methods. This book describes existing and
    advanced methods to reduce the dimensionality of numerical databases. For
    each method, the description starts from intuitive ideas, develops the
    necessary mathematical details, and ends by outlining the algorithmic
    implementation. Methods are compared with each other with the help of
    different illustrative examples. The purpose of the book is to summarize
    clear facts and ideas about well-known methods as well as recent
    developments in the topic of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. With this
    goal in mind, methods are all described from a unifying point of view, in
    order to highlight their respective strengths and shortcomings. The book
    is primarily intended for statisticians, computer scientists and data
    analysts. It is also accessible to other practitioners having a basic
    background in statistics and/or computational learning, like psychologists
    (in psychometry) and economists.}

The method can best be thought of as an analysis approach, to guide and assist in the use of any of a wide range of available clustering algorithms. We call the new methodology consensus clustering, and in conjunction with resampling techniques, it provides for a method to represent the consensus across multiple runs of a clustering algorithm and to assess the stability of the discovered clusters. The method can also be used to represent the consensus over multiple runs of a clustering algorithm with random restart (such as K-means, model-based Bayesian clustering, SOM, etc.), so as to account for its sensitivity to the initial conditions. Finally, it provides for a visualization tool to inspect cluster number, membership, and boundaries. We present the results of our experiments on both simulated data and real gene expression data aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the methodology in discovering biologically meaningful clusters.",

for thousands of genes simultaneously. In time-course
experiments in which gene expression is monitored over time, we
are interested in testing gene expression profiles for different

based on the ANOVA model to identify genes that
have different gene expression profiles among experimental
groups in time-course experiments. Especially,
we propose a permutation test which does
not require the normality assumption. For this test,
we use residuals from the ANOVA model only with
time-effects. Using this test, we detect genes that
have different gene expression profiles among experimental
groups. The proposed model is illustrated
using cDNA microarrays of 3840 genes obtained in
an experiment to search for changes in gene expression
profiles during neuronal differentiation of cortical
stem cells.Availability: A set of programs written by R will be

is folded in three-dimensional (3D) space is crucial for unravelling the
complex regulatory mechanisms underlying the differentiation and proliferation
of cells. With recent high-throughput adaptations of chromosome conformation
capture in techniques such as single-cell Hi-C, it is now possible to probe 3D
information of chromosomes genome-wide. Such experiments, however, only
provide sparse information about contacts between regions in the genome. We
have developed a tool, based on manifold based optimization (MBO), that
reconstructs 3D structures from such contact information. We show that MBO
allows for reconstruction of 3D genomes more consistent with the original
contact map, and with fewer structural violations compared to other, related
methods. Since MBO is also computationally fast, it can be used for
high-throughput and large-scale 3D reconstruction of entire genomes.</p>},

these genes are usually referred to as dropouts. Here, we present a general
and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB-WaVE), which leads to
low-dimensional representations of the data that account for zero inflation
(dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count nature of the data. We demonstrate,
with simulations and real data, that the model and its associated estimation
procedure are able to give a more stable and accurate low-dimensional
representation of the data than principal component analysis (PCA) and
zero-inflated factor analysis (ZIFA), without the need for a preliminary
normalization step.},

A major goal is to understand how these properties emerge from the global pattern of interactions between amino acid residues. Here, we describe the principles and implementation of the statistical coupling analysis (SCA), a method to reveal this pattern through analysis of coevolution between amino acids in an ensemble of homologous sequences. The basic result is a decomposition of protein structures into groups of contiguous amino acids called “sectors” which have been linked to conserved functional properties. This work provides conceptual and practical tools for sector analysis in any sufficiently well-represented protein family, and represents a necessary basis for broadly testing the concept of protein sectors.},

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighbor-hood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

`lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the
absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the
nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are
exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest
that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset
selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset
selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an
interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by
Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a
variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and
tree-based models are briefly described.},

We grew 2 cultivars of the naturally drought-tolerant food crop sorghum in the field under drought stress. We sequenced the mRNA from weekly samples of these plants, resulting in a molecular profile of drought response over the growing season. We find molecular differences in the 2 cultivars that help explain their differing tolerances to drought and evidence of a disruption in the plant{\textquoteright}s symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Our findings are of practical importance for agricultural breeding programs, while the resulting data are a resource for the plant and microbial communities for studying the dynamics of drought response.Drought is the most important environmental stress limiting crop yields. The C4 cereal sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is a critical food, forage, and emerging bioenergy crop that is notably drought-tolerant. We conducted a large-scale field experiment, imposing preflowering and postflowering drought stress on 2 genotypes of sorghum across a tightly resolved time series, from plant emergence to postanthesis, resulting in a dataset of nearly 400 transcriptomes. We observed a fast and global transcriptomic response in leaf and root tissues with clear temporal patterns, including modulation of well-known drought pathways. We also identified genotypic differences in core photosynthesis and reactive oxygen species scavenging pathways, highlighting possible mechanisms of drought tolerance and of the delayed senescence, characteristic of the stay-green phenotype. Finally, we discovered a large-scale depletion in the expression of genes critical to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, with a corresponding drop in AM fungal mass in the plants{\textquoteright} roots.},

    abstract = "{For eukaryotic cells, the biological processes involving regulatory DNA elements play an important role in cell cycle. Understanding 3D spatial arrangements of chromosomes and revealing long-range chromatin interactions are critical to decipher these biological processes. In recent years, chromosome conformation capture (3C) related techniques have been developed to measure the interaction frequencies between long-range genome loci, which have provided a great opportunity to decode the 3D organization of the genome. In this paper, we develop a new Bayesian framework to derive the 3D architecture of a chromosome from 3C-based data. By modeling each chromosome as a polymer chain, we define the conformational energy based on our current knowledge on polymer physics and use it as prior information in the Bayesian framework. We also propose an expectation-maximization (EM) based algorithm to estimate the unknown parameters of the Bayesian model and infer an ensemble of chromatin structures based on interaction frequency data. We have validated our Bayesian inference approach through cross-validation and verified the computed chromatin conformations using the geometric constraints derived from fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments. We have further confirmed the inferred chromatin structures using the known genetic interactions derived from other studies in the literature. Our test results have indicated that our Bayesian framework can compute an accurate ensemble of 3D chromatin conformations that best interpret the distance constraints derived from 3C-based data and also agree with other sources of geometric constraints derived from experimental evidence in the previous studies. The source code of our approach can be found in https://github.com/wangsy11/InfMod3DGen.}",

abstract = {We investigate how to learn a kernel matrix for high dimensional data that lies on or near a low dimensional manifold. Noting that the kernel matrix implicitly maps the data into a nonlinear feature space, we show how to discover a mapping that "unfolds" the underlying manifold from which the data was sampled. The kernel matrix is constructed by maximizing the variance in feature space subject to local constraints that preserve the angles and distances between nearest neighbors. The main optimization involves an instance of semidefinite programming---a fundamentally different computation than previous algorithms for manifold learning, such as Isomap and locally linear embedding. The optimized kernels perform better than polynomial and Gaussian kernels for problems in manifold learning, but worse for problems in large margin classification. We explain these results in terms of the geometric properties of different kernels and comment on various interpretations of other manifold learning algorithms as kernel methods.},
