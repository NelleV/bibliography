abstract="Stomata regulate rates of carbon assimilation and water loss. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses often modify stomatal behavior and therefore play pivotal roles in plant productivity. The size of the AM effect on stomatal conductance to water vapor (gs) has varied widely, has not always been apparent, and is unpredictable. We conducted a meta-analysis of 460 studies to determine the size of the AM effect under ample watering and drought and to examine how experimental conditions have influenced the AM effect. Across all host and symbiont combinations under all soil moisture conditions, AM plants have shown 24 {\%} higher gsthan nonmycorrhizal (NM) controls. The promotion of gshas been over twice as great during moderate drought than under amply watered conditions. The AM influence on gshas been even more pronounced under severe drought, with over four times the promotion observed with ample water. Members of the Claroideoglomeraceae, Glomeraceae, and other AM families stimulated gsby about the same average amount. Colonization by native AM fungi has produced the largest promotion. Among single-AM symbionts, Glomus deserticola, Claroideoglomus etunicatum, and Funneliformis mosseae have had the largest average effects on gsacross studies. Dicotyledonous hosts, especially legumes, have been slightly more responsive to AM symbiosis than monocotyledonous hosts, and C3 plants have shown over twice the AM-induced promotion of C4 plants. The extent of root colonization is important, with heavily colonized plants showing {\texttimes}10 the gspromotion of lightly colonized plants. AM promotion of gshas been larger in growth chambers and in the field than in greenhouse studies, almost {\texttimes}3 as large when plants were grown under high light than low light, and {\texttimes}2.5 as large in purely mineral soils than in soils having an organic component. When AM plants have been compared with NM controls given NM pot culture, they have shown only half the promotion of gsas NM plants not given anything at inoculation to control for associated soil organisms. The AM effect has been much greater when AM plants were larger or had more phosphorus than NM controls. These findings should assist in further investigations of predictions and mechanisms of the AM influence on host gs.",

    abstract = { Mediation is a causal process that evolves over time. Thus, a
study of mediation requires data collected throughout the process. However,
most applications of mediation analysis use cross-sectional rather than
longitudinal data. Another implicit assumption commonly made in longitudinal
designs for mediation analysis is that the same mediation process universally
applies to all members of the population under investigation. This assumption
ignores the important issue of ergodicity before aggregating the data across
subjects. We first argue that there exists a discrepancy between the concept
of mediation and the research designs that are typically used to investigate
it. Second, based on the concept of ergodicity, we argue that a given
mediation process probably is not equally valid for all individuals in a
population. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to propose a two-faceted
solution. The first facet of the solution is that we advocate a single-subject
time-series design that aligns data collection with researchers’ conceptual
understanding of mediation. The second facet is to introduce a flexible
statistical method—the state space model—as an ideal technique to analyze
single-subject time series data in mediation studies. We provide an overview
of the state space method and illustrative applications using both simulated
and real time series data. Finally, we discuss additional issues related to
research design and modeling. }

heels of Statistics since its earliest days. Correlation does not imply
causation and yet causal conclusions drawn from a carefully designed
experiment are often valid. What can a statistical model say about causation?
This question is addressed by using a particular model for causal inference
(Rubin, 1974; Holland and Rubin, 1983) to critique the discussions of other
writers on causation and causal inference. These include selected
philosophers, medical researchers, statisticians, econometricians, and
proponents of causal modelling.}

@article{huang:integrative,
abstract = {Given the availability of genomic data, there have been emerging
interests in integrating multi-platform data. Here, we propose to model
genetics (single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)), epigenetics (DN
A methylation), and gene expression data as a biological process to delineate
phenotypic traits under the framework of causal mediation modeling. We propose
a regression model for the joint effect of SNPs, methyla
tion, gene expression, and their nonlinear interactions on the outcome and
develop a variance component score test for any arbitrary set of regression
coefficients. The test statistic under the null follows a mixt
u
re of chi-square distributions, which can be approximated using a
characteristic function inversion method or a perturbation procedure. We
construct tests for candidate models determined by different combinations of
SNPs, DNA methylation, gene expression, and interactions and further propose
an omnibus test to accommodate different models. We then study three
path-specific effects: the direct effect of SNPs on the outcome, the effect
mediated through expression, and the effect through methylation. We
characterize correspondences between the three path-specific effects and
coefficients in the regression model, which are influenced by causal relations
among SNPs, DNA methylation, and gene expression. We illustrate the utility of
our method in two genomic studies and numerical simulation studies. Copyright

abstract = {Hypotheses involving mediation are common in the behavioral
sciences. Mediation exists when a predictor affects a dependent variable
indirectly through at least one intervening variable, or mediator. Methods to
assess mediation involving multiple simultaneous mediators have received
little attention in the methodological literature despite a clear need. We
provide an overview of simple and multiple mediation and explore three
approaches that can be used to investigate indirect processes, as well as
methods for contrasting two or more mediators within a single model. We
present an illustrative example, assessing and contrasting potential mediators
of the relationship between the helpfulness of socialization agents and job
satisfaction. We also provide SAS and SPSS macros, as well as Mplus and LISREL
syntax, to facilitate the use of these methods in applications.},

technique that enables researchers to measure gene expression at the
resolution of single cells. Because of the low amount of RNA present in a
single cell, many genes fail to be detected even though they are expressed;
these genes are usually referred to as dropouts. Here, we present a general
and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB-WaVE), which leads to
low-dimensional representations of the data that account for zero inflation
(dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count nature of the data. We demonstrate,
with simulations and real data, that the model and its associated estimation
procedure are able to give a more stable and accurate low-dimensional
representation of the data than principal component analysis (PCA) and
zero-inflated factor analysis (ZIFA), without the need for a preliminary
normalization step.},

 abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The
`lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the
absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the
nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are
exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest
that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset
selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset
selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an
interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by
Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a
variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and
tree-based models are briefly described.},
